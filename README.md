# Drug Price Tracker

Me and my team have built a drug price tracker system that helps people find the best pharmacy website to purchase medicines.

## How to Run the Code

1. Install the requirements:
pip install requirements.txt



2. Add the data to the data folder:
Add all drug names, prices, the website from where you collected them, and the date you added the data. This helps track price trends over time.

3. Run the application:
python app.py

4. Open the browser:
http://127.0.0.1:5000

## Features

1. User login / signup
2. Search for a particular drug
3. Compare prices across different websites
4. View prices from all websites and find the best option
5. Save a drug in the watchlist for future reference

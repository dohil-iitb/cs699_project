📁 Scrapers Folder

The scrapers/ folder contains all Python scripts responsible for scraping data from different pharmacy websites.
Each scraper script:

Sends automated search requests to the target website

Extracts product details such as name, price, availability

Cleans and structures the scraped data

Saves the final output into the data/ folder in CSV format for further processing (EDA, analysis, visualization, etc.)

This ensures all scraped datasets are consistently stored and ready for downstream tasks.

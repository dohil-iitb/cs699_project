This project extracts medicine prices from the  website using web scraping, cleans the data, and performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
to understand pricing patterns. The goal is to identify trends, cheapest and costliest medicines, and generate meaningful insights that can 
support price comparison across pharmacies.
